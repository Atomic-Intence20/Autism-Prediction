# Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. It analyzes relevant features from diagnostic data and employs classification models to determine the likelihood of ASD in individuals.

## Project Structure
- **Autism.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This documentation file that explains the project's purpose, setup, and usage.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Autism.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the full analysis and prediction pipeline.

## Objective
To leverage machine learning for early detection of autism based on standardized diagnostic data, ultimately aiming to support timely intervention and care.

## Author
This project was developed as part of a data science initiative to apply ML techniques in healthcare.
